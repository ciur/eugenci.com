I launched a web resource, online lessons, about web development in Django Framework and related technologies. I have created an [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3YTUJaWjmCHll2O9w0CrJw), [twitter account](https://twitter.com/DjangoLessons), [github account](https://github.com/ciur). As of today [www.django-lessons.com](https://www.django-lessons.com) is online!


It doesn't look like a big deal - just a couple of screencasts wrapped around
in a simple web app and augmented with some social media - but it is soo much
work!

Content is the king. I plan weekly releases of high quality screencasts.

Merry Chrismas!
