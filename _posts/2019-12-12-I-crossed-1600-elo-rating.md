Yay! In chess play I crossed 1600 ELO rating for classical 15+15 games.  Here
is [my user profile](https://lichess.org/@/witla) on lichess.org.

But the truth is that I cheated. How? Well, most of the games I play online
jointly with my son (which as of 2019 - is 8 years old). Obviously when two
persons play together (against another online person) they are advantaged,
because they are less likely to do blunt mistakes.

No matter what - I am very happy with my (our) results in chess!
