    <p>Since 2 years I have a new hobby - chess. I started from an absolute beginner level with
zero prior experience.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/chess.png" alt="chess" /></p>

<p>One can learn basic chess theory in matter of days or at most couple of weeks
of youtube videos on the subject; maybe one or two books will help as well. As
a matter of the fact in Germany chess is taught in primary school. I have seen
many 6 or 7 years kids pretty good with chess basics. My point here is that as
a skill it is defined by few very simple rules - so simple - that 6 y.o.
kids can learn the them without much effort.</p>

<p>However, what I find absolutely amazing about chess is how much practice it
requires to truly master the game. By mastering the game I mean having <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_rating_system#Elo_rating_system">ELO
rating</a>
of  say 1800. For me, following a moderate self-taught training, I needed 2
years to increase my ELO number by 200 points - from a weak 1300 to a strong
1500 (for classical games with 15 minutes per side and 15 seconds increment).
I think I will need another 10 years of training to cross ELO 2000 boundary.</p>

<p>It is fascinating - that for a simple skill such as chess game play, a person
needs around 10 or 12 years of moderate practice, with only a minimal theory,
to master the subject. For Bobby Fischer it took exactly 23 years (counting
from his first chess experience) to becomes World Champion in 1972.</p>

<p>What about more complex skills - how much time of practical experience it is
necessary to really master computer programming? Computers, where for theory
alone is elaborate! What about mastering the subject of how to implement
distributed computer network systems? Compilers? Computer operating systems?</p>
